Task 1: ReverseString
  - The reverse_String.js file is run with the command "node reverse_String.js". It takes in a single command line argument. If your string contains any integers, the program will prompt you to either restart or continue since integers may be erroneous. The function reverseString runs in O(n) time using built-in Javascript string functions.

Task 2: FizzBuzz
  - The fizzBuzz.js file is run with the command "node fizzBuzz.js". It takes in no arguments, and outputs the correct value for each integer with a simple for loop.

Task 3: Even or Odd
  - The even_odd.js file is run with the command "node even_odd.js". It takes in a single command line argument of an integer and returns if that integer is even or odd. If you enter a noninteger value the program will display your error and you will restart.

Task 4: Simple Interactive Feature
  - The page shows an off-black main color with white buttons that animate when you hover over them. A user can click the change button to toggle the header text from "Hello There" to "Goodbye Then". The page is in a minimalist style.
